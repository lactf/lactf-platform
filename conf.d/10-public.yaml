  ## Eligibility
  Anyone can participate in LA CTF. However, due to various reasons, we can only guarantee that prizes can be awarded to teams in the United States. In order for a team to be eligible for UCLA-specific prizes, all members of the team must be current UCLA undergraduate students.

  ## Rules
  1. You may use any tool, subject to the restrictions below, at your disposal to attempt to solve the problems. We especially encourage the use of free and open-source tools. Google is your best friend!
  2. During the competition, each person may only be a part of **one team** total, and only members of a given team may assist in solving a challenge for that team. You may not seek out "new" help; you are free to use any online or external resources provided they existed before the competition start time. Programs such as ChatGPT or online support forums that generate "new" content may not be used.
  3. Each team must have a valid email address that should serve as the point of contact. UCLA students should use a @g.ucla.edu email to register for access to the UCLA-only division.
  4. There are two divisions for teams, **UCLA** and **Open**. Teams in the UCLA-only division may consist of up to **four** participants, all of which must be **current undergraduate UCLA students**. Open division teams have no team size or makeup restrictions. UCLA students may choose to participate in either division but not both.
  5. No flag or hint sharing. Do **not** accept hints or guidance from anyone except through official support channels.
  6. Do **not** attempt to attack or interfere with other teams or any servers used in this competition that are not explicitly designated for being hacked in a problem. If you ever have a question about whether something is allowed, please ask!
  7. No brute-force guessing flags. Feel free to try several flags if you're not sure, but don't try any sort of brute forcing on the scoreboard platform.
  8. Finally, **have fun and try and learn something new**!

  ## Scoring
  1. Each problem has a point value listed. The team who earns the most points wins the competition. If two teams have the same number of points, the tiebreak is which team reached their top score first.
  2. Challenges are subject to **dynamic scoring**: the **more** teams that solve a particular challenge, the **less** points that challenge will be worth to **all** teams who solved the challenge. There is no time score bonus awarded.
  3. The prize winning teams will be contacted by us after the contest ends. Please make sure the email used to register the team is accurate.
  4. We reserve the right to require write-ups from the winning teams for any problems we choose as proofs of solution.
  5. In the event that a team that is ineligible for prizes wins a prize, the next eligible team will recieve that prize. It may take some time for prizes to settle; please be patient!
  6. Anyone who violates these rules will be disqualified. **All decisions made by LA CTF organizers are final**.

  ## Prizes
  In order to be eligible for prizes, UCLA teams **must** include all team member email addresses in their team profile at [https://platform.lac.tf](https://platform.lac.tf); open teams will use the email listed in the profile as the prize point of contact.  
  We reserve the right to require verification of prize eligibility, including, but not limited to, write-ups.

  ## FAQ:
  **How does registration work? There was a google form and now this?**
  - As LA CTF is both an in-person and online event, there is a google form registration for LA CTF the event, and there is a team registration on this website for the online CTF competition. If you plan to participate in-person or online, please fill out the google form found under "register" at [https://lactf.uclaacm.com/](https://lactf.uclaacm.com/), but to participate in the CTF, you **MUST** have your team register once on this website.
  **I registered for a team, but I never got a confirmation email!**
  - Please be patient; it may take up to 15 minutes for the email to arrive. Especially if you use outlook/microsoft 365, make sure to check your junk folders! If you still haven't received a confirmation email, please contact us using one of the methods listed above.
  **I misspelled my team name when registering/used the wrong email when verifying**
  - You can change your team name and/or the email linked to your team account once your email is verified.
  **I misspelled my email when submitting the register form!**
  - Just resubmit the team registration form; you can even use the same team name. Your team name is not reserved until your email has been verified.
  **How do I login? I never noticed any sort of password or something to register**
  - Great question! Once you are logged in, make sure you save the "Team Invite" URL and send it to your team - anyone with the link can simply login to the team account.
  **I'm trying to register but the captcha is not letting me register! I've tried ${some large number greater than 3} times!**
  - If you have other people in your team, see if they can register on the website for you. If you still have trouble, contact us using one of the methods above and we can help. Captchas are only used when taking actions that result in sending an email.
  **I have another question regarding a challenge/our ctf team account/the rules/something else**
