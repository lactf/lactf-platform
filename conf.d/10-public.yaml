  ## In-Person Event
  Join us at the Kerckhoff Grand Salon at UCLA during the CTF for speakers and other fun events! Schedule will be released soon!
  <!-- More information on the schedule can be found at [schedule.lac.tf](http://schedule.lac.tf). -->

  ## Eligibility
  Anyone can participate in LA CTF (except organizers, ACM Cyber interns and officers, and challenge authors). However, due to various reasons, we can only award prizes to teams with a United States-based point-of-contact, and in the form of US Amazon Gift Cards. In order for a team to be eligible for UCLA-specific prizes, all members of the team must be current UCLA students.

  ## Rules
  1. You may use any tool, subject to the restrictions below, at your disposal to attempt to solve the problems. We especially encourage the use of free and open-source tools. Google is your best friend!
  2. During the competition, each person may only be a part of **one team** total, and only members of a given team may assist in solving a challenge for that team. Do not share flags, challenge solutions, tips, hints, or otherwise implicitly or explicitly leak information about solving challenges outside your team until after the CTF is over.
  3. Each team must have a valid email address that should serve as the point of contact. UCLA students should use a @g.ucla.edu email to register for access to the UCLA-only division.
  4. There are two divisions for teams, **UCLA** and **Open**. Teams in the UCLA-only division may consist of up to **four** participants, all of which must be **current UCLA students**. Open division teams have no team size or makeup restrictions. UCLA students may choose to participate in either division but not both.
  5. No flag or hint sharing. Do **not** solicit or accept hints or guidance from anyone except through official support channels.
  6. Do **not** attempt to attack or interfere with other teams or any servers used in this competition that are not explicitly designated for being hacked in a problem. Do not perform any sort of online bruteforce against any of our systems including challenges, such as dirbuster or nmap - it won't help. If you ever have a question about whether something is allowed, please ask!
  7. No brute-force guessing flags. Feel free to try several flags if you're not sure, but don't try any sort of brute forcing on the scoreboard platform.
  8. Finally, **have fun and try and learn something new**!

  ## Scoring
  1. Each problem has a point value listed. The team who earns the most points wins the competition. If two teams have the same number of points, the tiebreak is which team reached their top score first.
  2. Challenges are subject to **dynamic scoring**: the **more** teams that solve a particular challenge, the **less** points that challenge will be worth to **all** teams who solved the challenge. There is no time score bonus awarded.
  3. The prize winning teams will be contacted by us after the contest ends. Please make sure the email used to register the team is the email you'd like us to contact.
  4. We reserve the right to require write-ups from the winning teams for any problems we choose as proofs of solution.
  5. In the event that a team that is ineligible for prizes wins a prize, the next eligible team will recieve that prize. It may take some time for prizes to settle; please be patient!
  6. Anyone who violates these rules will be disqualified. **All decisions made by LA CTF organizers are final**.

  ## Prizes
  The prizes for the 2024 edition of LACTF are to be determined. Stay tuned!
